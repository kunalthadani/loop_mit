		Genesis is a three day long event comprising of workshops conducted by experienced industry people as well as accomplished seniors in the college targeted towards the members of IECSE, the official computer science club of MIT Manipal. The aim of this event is to introduce various fields of computer science to students of all fields and hence uplift the technical culture of the college

		<h1>OUR SUBSYSTEMS</h1>
		<div class = "flex-container">
			<div class ="flex-item">
				<h2>COMPOSITES</h2>
				Materials are integral part of any project.Selection of right material is necessary for converting the design into efficient and sustainable product.In Composite subsystem we aim to use high strength/weight material for the shell and frame of the pod in order achieve high speed by  combating air resistance.
			</div>
			<div class ="flex-item">
				<h2>VEHICLE DYNAMICS</h2>
				The propulsion subsystem is the heart of the pod. We use a Linear Induction Motor which works on the same principle as a regular induction motor but creates a linear thrust force instead of rotary motion. The primary is mounted on the pod while the aluminium track acts as the secondary to produce the required eddy currents.
			</div>
			<div class ="flex-item">
				<h2>AERODYNAMICS</h2>
				The goal of the subsystem to is create a aerodynamically efficient pod to minimize losses due to air resistance. It deals with designing the bodywork & designing the framework.
			</div>
			<div class ="flex-item">
				<h2>LEVITATION</h2>
				With Levitation we aim to incorporate cutting edge technologies in magnetic fields and their interactions with conductors. We wish to eliminate rolling friction by having the pod 'hover' and attain remarkable speeds with maximum efficiency!

				<h2>PROPULSION</h2>
				The propulsion subsystem is the heart of the pod. We use a Linear Induction Motor which works on the same principle as a regular induction motor but creates a linear thrust force instead of rotary motion. The primary is mounted on the pod while the aluminium track acts as the secondary to produce the required eddy currents.
			</div>
			<div class ="flex-item">
				<h2>ELECTRONICS</h2>
				Electronics subsystem deals with the entire electrical and electronic components going into the pod, mainly the battery management system, main computer control unit, motor controller, wiring harness and other sensing and automation systems.
			</div>
			<div class ="flex-item">
				<h2>MANAGEMENT</h2>
					The role of the management subsystem of this team is to create a work environment that supports innovative thinking and engineering. This subsystem comprises of Finances and sponsorships, Media management and web development, Human resources and safety management. The management subdivision brings together all the other factions of the team to create a Hyperloop pod that is ingenious, efficient and safe.
