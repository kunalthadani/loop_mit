		loopMIT is a dedicated team of undergraduate students from various fields of engineering working on designing , developing and building a sub scale prototype transport vehicle known as the Hyperloop Pod to partake in the “SpaceX Hyperloop pod design competition” ,where a number of student teams from across the world participate to demonstrate the technical feasibility of various aspects of the Hyperloop concept . We aim to be the first Asian team to enter the competition with a levitating pod.<br><br>
		A Hyperloop  is a mode of passenger and freight transportation, used to describe an open-source vacuum tube train design released by a joint team from Tesla and SpaceX. Hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speeds efficiently, drastically reducing travel times over medium-range distances.<br>
		<br> 
The concept was unveiled in 2013 by Elon Musk- founder of SpaceX and Tesla, in which he proposed a “fifth mode of transport” comprised of pressurized capsules riding on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. In 2015, a design competition was announced for teams to build Hyperloop pods to operate on a SpaceX sponsored track. If successful, this would revolutionize the field of transportation across the world

				<span class = "info" data-sub = "vehicle-dynamics">The propulsion subsystem is the heart of the pod. We use a Linear Induction Motor which works on the same principle as a regular induction motor but creates a linear thrust force instead of rotary motion. The primary is mounted on the pod while the aluminium track acts as the secondary to produce the required eddy currents.</span>

				<h2>LEVITATION</h2>
				<span class = "info" data-sub = "levitation">With Levitation we aim to incorporate cutting edge technologies in magnetic fields and their interactions with conductors. We wish to eliminate rolling friction by having the pod 'hover' and attain remarkable speeds with maximum efficiency!</span>

				<h2>ELECTRONICS</h2>
				<span class = "info" data-sub = "electronics">Electronics subsystem deals with the entire electrical and electronic components going into the pod, mainly the battery management system, main computer control unit, motor controller, wiring harness and other sensing and automation systems.</span>

			<div class ="flex-item management">
				<h2>MANAGEMENT</h2>
					<span class = "info" data-sub = "management">The role of the management subsystem is to create a work environment that supports innovative thinking. It comprises of Finances and sponsorships, Media management and web development, Human resources and safety management. It brings together all the other factions of the team to create a Hyperloop pod that is efficient and safe.</span>
